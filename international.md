# Movements outside the country

To begin our journey around the world, we first display a simple plot of the most popular international tourist destinations. The figure below shows popular cities, and the size of each marker corresponds to the number of check-ins to that location. 

<!-- Plot -->

We notice that the most popular cities are mostly metropoles or megalopoles in developed countries. They're mostly big-name tourist cities that people first think of when picking a destination. Letâ€™s take a closer look at some of them to see if we can observe some smaller-scale trends. 

It is interesting to know where users check-in the most, compared to the local population of their destination city. We further inspect two cities -- San Francisco, California and Paris, France to see if we can spot any tourist behavior. We superimpose the check-ins of local users (i.e. Americans) and international travelers. 

<!-- Plot -->

While the local population spreads into the suburbs and the more residential parts of the city, the tourists tend to be more concentrated around the city-center (and the airport in the case of Paris), where most tourist attractions are located. So, if you plan on visiting San Francisco or Paris and you want to avoid those silly tourists, stay away from the center!
