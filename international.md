# Movements outside the country
- When people travel, they usually choose their destination based on distance, popularity and depending on local/national trends (i.e. where do their friends or people from the same country go, can we spot a spike in visits around large events (olympics, festivals)?). We are interested in the variability of the popularity of a place during different times of the year, like differences between tourism numbers in different months or seasons.
- Do travelers from certain countries tend to travel more often to specific places? (we might expect people to travel more to countries within close proximity of one another, i.e. US-Canada, Switzerland-Germany, etc)?
