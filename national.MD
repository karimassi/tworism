# Movements inside the country

Intra-country user movements can help us understand what drives people to travel far from their home, or even change homes during certain periods. 
- How do people tend to travel within their own country? Do people travel within their own country more frequently than they travel abroad?
- When people travel within their own country, do they tend to go to different locations than people visiting from abroad?
- We will do a case study on the United States, as this is the country from which we have by far the most data
- We will attempt this same analysis for other countries as wellâ€¦ how do these trends differ from country to country? Can this tell us something about the culture?
