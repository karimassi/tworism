The data of location based social networks can teach us a lot about human behavior. This ranges from understanding the ties between social interaction and distance, to building models to predict human mobility. We would like to uncover hidden patterns in the data to put together a fact sheet that can be used in tourism and travel industries. 

To realize this, we will study user movements periodically, depending on the season or month of the year. More specifically, we want to know when people move more, and when are they likely to break their routine. Because tourism is so diverse, we will consider the markets for national and international separately.
